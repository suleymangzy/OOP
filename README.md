# 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

This GitHub project is dedicated to implementing and demonstrating fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The project covers a wide range of OOP principles such as student management, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## 🌟 Features

This repository provides a diverse set of examples, each highlighting key OOP principles:

### 1. **📚 Student Management System**
   - **Student Class**: Capture and manage student names and surnames with proper encapsulation.
   - **Department and Course Classes**: Illustrate relationships between entities like `Department`, `Course`, and `Student`, with a focus on inheritance and composition.

### 2. **🏠 House Management**
   - **House Class**: Implement and manage object references, allowing for updates to house addresses while ensuring data integrity.

### 3. **⏰ Encapsulation in Time Management**
   - **Time Class**: Apply encapsulation to manage time consistently, with getter and setter methods controlling access to time data.

### 4. **🔧 JavaBean Standard Implementation**
   - **JavaBean Class**: Follow the JavaBean standard to create reusable components, showcasing best practices with encapsulation, constructors, and accessor methods.

### 5. **🚗 Vehicle Hierarchy**
   - **Inheritance and Method Overriding**: Explore a vehicle hierarchy where inheritance defines common characteristics, and method overriding provides specialized behavior in subclasses.

### 6. **🎸 Instrument Hierarchy**
   - **Polymorphism and Late Binding**: Utilize abstract classes and method overriding to create an instrument hierarchy, demonstrating the power of polymorphism and late binding.
   - **Interface Implementation**: Implement interfaces to enforce method contracts across different instrument classes, further illustrating polymorphism.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Any Java-supported Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA.
