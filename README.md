# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

This GitHub project is a Java project designed to implement and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The project includes OOP concepts such as capturing student names and surnames, house class functionality, department, course, and student classes, encapsulation in the time class, the JavaBean standard, inheritance in a vehicle hierarchy, late binding and method overriding in an instrument hierarchy, abstract classes and method overriding, interfaces for instrument classes, and polymorphism.

## Features

This repository includes a diverse set of examples, each showcasing different OOP principles:

### 1. **Student Management System**
   - **Student Class**: Capture and manage student names and surnames with encapsulation.
   - **Department and Course Classes**: Illustrate relationships between entities such as `Department`, `Course`, and `Student`, emphasizing inheritance and composition.

### 2. **House Management**
   - **House Class**: Implement and manage object references, enabling the ability to change and update house addresses while maintaining data integrity.

### 3. **Encapsulation in Time Management**
   - **Time Class**: Apply encapsulation to ensure meaningful and consistent time management, providing getter and setter methods that control access to time data.

### 4. **JavaBean Standard Implementation**
   - **JavaBean Class**: Adhere to the JavaBean standard, demonstrating best practices for creating reusable components with proper encapsulation, constructors, and accessor methods.

### 5. **Vehicle Hierarchy**
   - **Inheritance and Method Overriding**: Explore a vehicle hierarchy where inheritance is used to define common characteristics, and method overriding is employed for specialized behavior in subclasses.

### 6. **Instrument Hierarchy**
   - **Polymorphism and Late Binding**: Use abstract classes and method overriding to create an instrument hierarchy that highlights the power of polymorphism and late binding.
   - **Interface Implementation**: Demonstrate the use of interfaces to enforce method contracts across different instrument classes, further illustrating polymorphism.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Any Java-supported Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA.
